            <p>My name is Adela and I was born and raised in the Bay Area, California. More specifically right outside of San Jose, called Los Gatos! </p>
            <p>I am currently a third year at Seattle University and one of my favorite things to do is travel! </p>
            <p>This past summer, I was very grateful and able to travel to a lot of different places, visiting friends and family. </p>
            <p>In summer 2023, I traveled to Manhattan, New York, Palisades, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Seoul, South Korea, Honolulu, Hawaii, and San Francisco, California! </p>
